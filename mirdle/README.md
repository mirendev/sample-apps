A word guessing game where you have to discover the secret word by making guesses and receiving feedback on each letter.

## How to Play

Enter a 5-letter word guess. After each guess, you'll see:
- Green letters are in the correct position
- Yellow letters are in the word but wrong position  
- Gray letters are not in the word

You have 7 attempts to find the word.
